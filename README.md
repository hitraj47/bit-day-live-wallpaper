# Bit Day Live Wallpaper

An Android live wallpaper that changes based on the time of day.

## Credits

I did not create the wallpaper images myself, they were created by Reddit users.

## Proposed Improvements

* I'm rubbish with graphics, perhaps a better looking icon?
* As the user swipes left or right on their home screens, the image moves accordingly. Right now, the images are scaled to fill the height and maintain a 1:1 aspect ratio, so the edges are not visible because the wallpaper is static. The base image resolution is 1920x1080.
